# Lubuntu-x205ta-set-up-scripts
These are the scripts I use to set up lubuntu 20.04 on asus eeebook x205ta.

To use these scripts, put all the files (not the folders, but the files in the folders) in the root directory then perform the following commands while in root.

```
sudo chmod +x lubuntu-x205ta-alsa-fix.sh
sudo chmod +x lubuntu-x205ta-bluetooth-fix.sh
./lubuntu-x205ta-alsa-fix.sh
./lubuntu-x205ta-bluetooth-fix.sh
```

Once these commands have finished, now you just need to reboot the computer for the fixes to take effect.
